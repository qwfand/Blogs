# [leetcode]1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

## 链接

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-corresponding-node-of-a-binary-tree-in-a-clone-of-that-tree/)

## 描述

&ensp;&emsp;Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

&ensp;&emsp;The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

&ensp;&emsp;Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

&ensp;&emsp;Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

Example 1:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e1.png)

Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
&ensp;&emsp;Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.
Example 2:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e2.png)

Input: tree = [7], target =  7
Output: 7
Example 3:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e3.png)

Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output: 4
Example 4:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e4.png)

Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5
Example 5:
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e5.png)

Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.

## solution

&ensp;&emsp;采用最朴素的BFS（广度优先遍历）即可;

```C++
class Solution {
public:
	TreeNode* getTargetCopy(TreeNode* original, TreeNode* cloned, TreeNode* target) {
		queue<TreeNode*> oq, cq;
		if (original == NULL)
			return NULL;
		oq.push(original);
		cq.push(cloned);

		while (!oq.empty())
		{
			TreeNode *tmp = oq.front();
			TreeNode *tmpC = cq.front();

			oq.pop();
			cq.pop();

			if (tmp == target)
				return tmpC;

			if (tmp->left)
			{
				oq.push(tmp->left);
				cq.push(tmpC->left);
			}

			if (tmp->right)
			{
				oq.push(tmp->right);
				cq.push(tmpC->right);
			}
		}
		return NULL;
	}
};
```

## 分析

&ensp;&emsp;时间复杂度 O（n）；n是二叉树中节点的个数,树种的每一个节点只会被遍历一次；
&ensp;&emsp;空间复杂度O(1)
